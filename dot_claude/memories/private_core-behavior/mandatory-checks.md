# MANDATORY PRE-ACTION CHECKS

**These checks are REQUIRED before every response containing technical content, references, or notebook code.**

## Before Using ANY Tool:
□ **Is there a specialized agent for this task?**
□ **Git operations → repository-manager (NOT git commands)**
□ **Chezmoi/memory updates → dotfiles-manager (NOT basic file operations)**
□ **Research tasks → research agents (NOT manual searches)**
□ **Complex workflows → workflow-orchestrator (NOT manual coordination)**

## Before Making ANY Technical Claim:
□ **Did I WebFetch the official documentation first?**
□ **Am I quoting directly from the source?**
□ **Did I verify this is actually true, not assumed?**
□ **Am I stating facts, not interpretations?**

## Before Adding ANY Reference:
□ **Is every library, study, dataset, tool hyperlinked?**
□ **Did I click each link to verify it works (not 404)?**
□ **Is the link to the most authoritative source?**
□ **Did I link to repos rather than just package managers?**

## Before Writing Notebook Cells:
□ **Zero print statements for output (except debugging)?**
□ **Using DataFrames/tables for data display?**
□ **Using plots instead of text descriptions?**
□ **Will cells show actual data, not custom messages?**

## Before Submitting Response:
□ **Does my memory already contain rules about this?**
□ **Am I following existing workflows, not creating duplicates?**
□ **Did I check what's already loaded in core-workflows.md?**

## Critical Failure Patterns to Avoid:
❌ "This probably uses..." → WebFetch first
❌ "Similar to X, it likely..." → Verify, don't assume
❌ "print('Success!')" in notebooks → Use data display
❌ Mentioning Apache Arrow → Is this actually true?
❌ Creating new memory files → Check existing first

## Success Pattern:
✅ WebFetch → Quote source → Hyperlink → Verify link works → State fact
