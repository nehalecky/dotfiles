I have been attempting to use 1pass for my secrets management alongside use of the SSH agent and cli op. You will help me resolve this first, by analyzing, planning, and iteratively executing and observing. You and I will work together to accomplish this, as you will require me to interact with applications interfaces, that our out of reach now from the terminal command line. \n\nAfter we're able to resolve this remote push issue (to capture changes), we're going to execute a full revamp of my local setup, but migration to chezmoi for dotfile management and then after, migraiton to starship prompt. Given you can see what's versioned in my homegrown dotfile manager (including the README which is there, which is out of date). One of the primary things we will establish is a readme that describes our enviroment setup, and this will be a primary interface to it's maintence and use in the future. Finally, do feel free to get a claude.md file setup that will capture guidance I give you along the way! Let's do this, take your time, and thanks much! Very exciting :) ",
