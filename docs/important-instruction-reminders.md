# Important Instruction Reminders

## Core Principles
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## Verification First
- ALWAYS verify tool documentation with WebFetch before suggesting commands
- Provide clickable URLs for references (iTerm2 makes them clickable)
- Ground suggestions in actual documentation, not assumptions
- Check all paths use `$HOME` not hardcoded usernames

## User Preferences
- Terminal-first approach preferred
- Values clean, well-documented code
- Performance and security are top priorities
- Minimal dependencies preferred
- Present proposals before implementing complex changes

## Security Reminders
- Never expose secrets or credentials
- SSH keys stay in 1Password
- Always use the 1Password SSH agent
- GPG signing is configured and required
